Introduction [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ticketevolution/ticketevolution-ruby.png)](http://travis-ci.org/ticketevolution/ticketevolution-ruby)
============
The Ticket Evolution gem is a toolkit that provides a seamless and total wrapper around the Ticket Evolution APIs. Ticket Evolution uses the gem in-house to build consumer products.

The gem follows an instance based approach to the Restful API. This way multiple credentials can be used within the same environment, avoiding the static nature of ActiveResource. The classes allow you to access all endpoints of the API with a familiar ActiveRecord style -- convenient attribute methods, finders, etc.

All API documentation can be found at [http://developer.ticketevolution.com](http://developer.ticketevolution.com/).

_NOTE: Known issues and missing functionality are documented in the [Github Issues](https://github.com/ticketevolution/ticketevolution-ruby/issues)._
